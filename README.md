Purpose of Project:
* The purpose of this project is to turn the database that we have created and to make it a functioning website.
* This involves creating html files, (Which are shown in views) As well as adding functions that were mentioned in the rubric
* such as buying tickets, adding customer, customer login, etc.
* Additionally, we have additional requirements such as making sure our database is immune to SQL injections ("Delete Customer Tables LLC")
* and has correct authorization.

About each of the files:

index.html
* This is the homepage for our website, This will include buttons to redirect you to almost any other site you need (or functionality)

customer_login.html
* This is where customers will go to login to the server/do the things they must do like booking flights

customer_register.html
* This is where customers go to register a new account (with password and such)

staff_login.html
* This is where staff go to login.

staff_register.html
* This is where staff go to register and account.

ticket_purchase.html
* This is where ticket purchases will be made.

Delegation of Responsibilities
* Generally speaking, a majority of the project was done together/simultaneously, but each person did their fair share
* Responsibilities are outlined below based on person and on parts

Part 1:
* Both of us worked simultaneously on creating the ER diagrams together in draw.io
* Work was done together on voice calls while we both worked on drawing arrows as well as outline the different tables

Part 2:
* Both of us worked on the Relational Schemas as well as the queries themselves. 
* I (Matthew) was primarily responsible for creating the relational schemas and the basic outlines for the queries while Zaf 
* focused mainly on the queries themselves, making sure everything fit together including the inserts and the selections

Part 3:

Matthew Maung
* I worked specifically on buildling the html templates and styling them, as well as making sure the paths outlined in flask worked correctly. 
* Additionally, a majority of the coding for rendering views from the database was my work as well. 
* I focused more on the main ui that you're seeing, including the registration and login forms

Zaf Nazir
* Zaf specifically worked on making sure the queries matched the specifications of the project
* as well as made sure that the html correctly functioned with the app.py file
* additionally, he helped a lot with the review and maintenance section

Purpose of Project:
* The purpose of this project is to turn the database that we have created and to make it a functioning website.
* This involves creating html files, (Which are shown in views) As well as adding functions that were mentioned in the rubric
* such as buying tickets, adding customer, customer login, etc.
* Additionally, we have additional requirements such as making sure our database is immune to SQL injections ("Delete Customer Tables LLC")
* and has correct authorization.

About each of the files:

index.html
* This is the homepage for our website, This will include buttons to redirect you to almost any other site you need (or functionality)

customer_login.html
* This is where customers will go to login to the server/do the things they must do like booking flights
